  2. new_files is never initialized in VersionControlCacheUpdater.init() — 
  modified_files gets initialized but new_files doesn't, which will likely crash at runtime when new_files.append is
  called (vc_cacher.zig:324).
  
  4. updateCache writes an empty string first (vc_updater.zig:696) — 
  writeAll("") is a no-op and doesn't truncate the file. If the new content is shorter than the old content, you'll have leftover bytes. You'd need to truncate the file or recreate it.

  5. 1MB stack buffers everywhere — reader_buf, content_buffer, redir_buf, response_buf are all [1024 * 1024]u8 on the stack. 
  This could easily blow the stack, especially since downloadEntries allocates multiple 1MB buffers per iteration. Consider heap-allocating these.
